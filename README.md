# FlappyClone
This is my Flappy Bird clone, done without any tutorials. This isn't an advanced project, but I am still proud of it.
This project is on GitHub because I want to have the possibility to share this project. 

## You want to run this project on your own device?
- To run this project on your own device, you will need the Classes: Main, Player, Pipe, Controller.
- To display the Flappy bird, you will need one of the skins (e.g. flappyAlt). You should change the playerPath variable according to the skin you want to use.
- The same goes for the Pipes. You'll have to download the file.

## Want to help?
- I am open to almost any idea or pull requests.
- Please make sure to not change the whole concept of my project.
